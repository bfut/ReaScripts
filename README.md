## Step sequencer for items
* bfut_Step sequencer (copy first item on track and fill grid bar under mouse)
* bfut_Step sequencer (copy first item on track to grid bar under mouse).lua
* bfut_Remove item under mouse cursor (delete).lua

Copies first item on track under mouse cursor to grid bar under mouse cursor. Requires [SWS] extension.

Add a source media item at the beginning of your target track. Set a time selection, e.g. 16 grid bars. Hit play. As you add and remove media items, REAPER's arrange view now behaves like a pattern-based step sequencer. Try adjusting the grid divison.

How to set up:
  1. Install the scripts, and SWS.
  2. Toggle on "Options > Trim content behind media items when editing".
  3. Set mouse modifiers (Options > Preferences > Editing Behavior > Mouse Modifiers).
  4. Open Actions > Show action list
  5. Assign keyboard shortcuts to each script (e.g. SHIFT+Q, SHIFT+A, and SHIFT+D), respectively.  
  Holding a key combination, continuously executes a script.

How to use:
  1. There must be at least one item on the track under mouse cursor.
  2. Hover mouse over arrange view.
  3. Run the script.
